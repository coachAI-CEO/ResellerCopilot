# Velocity Score Explanation

## What is Velocity?

**Velocity** in reselling refers to **how quickly an item sells** - essentially, the speed at which inventory turns over. It's a critical metric for resellers because:

- **Faster velocity** = Quicker return on investment = More capital turnover
- **Slower velocity** = Tied-up capital = Less flexibility

## Velocity Score Levels

### 🟢 High Velocity
**Definition:** Item sells very quickly (typically within days to weeks)

**Characteristics:**
- Many recent sold listings on eBay/Amazon
- Consistent demand across multiple platforms
- Trending or popular branded items
- Items in high-demand categories (electronics, fashion, collectibles)
- Clear market indicators of strong buyer interest

**Example Items:**
- Popular sneakers (Nike, Adidas)
- Electronics (iPhone, gaming consoles)
- Trendy fashion items
- Hot collectibles

**Reseller Impact:**
- ✅ Fast inventory turnover
- ✅ Quick return on investment
- ✅ Lower risk of price depreciation
- ✅ More capital available for new purchases

### 🟠 Medium Velocity
**Definition:** Item sells at a moderate pace (typically weeks to months)

**Characteristics:**
- Some recent sold listings, but not as frequent
- Steady but not rapid demand
- Established market with consistent buyers
- Items that sell reliably but not instantly

**Example Items:**
- Brand-name clothing (not trending)
- Home goods and kitchen items
- Books and media
- Standard brand products

**Reseller Impact:**
- ⚠️ Moderate inventory turnover
- ⚠️ Capital tied up for longer periods
- ⚠️ Still profitable but slower ROI
- ⚠️ Less flexibility for quick pivots

---

### 🔴 Low Velocity
**Definition:** Item sells slowly (typically months or longer)

**Characteristics:**
- Few or no recent sold listings
- Niche or specialty items with limited market
- Seasonal items out of season
- Over-saturated market
- Items with very specific buyer demographics

**Example Items:**
- Out-of-season clothing
- Specialty niche products
- Items with limited appeal
- Oversaturated markets
- Very expensive luxury items

**Reseller Impact:**
- ❌ Slow inventory turnover
- ❌ Capital tied up for extended periods
- ❌ Higher risk of price depreciation
- ❌ Opportunity cost (could invest in faster-moving items)
- ❌ May need to discount to move inventory

## How Velocity is Assessed

The AI analyzes multiple factors to determine velocity:

1. **Recent Sold Listings:** How many items sold recently on eBay/Amazon
2. **Time to Sale:** How quickly listings convert to sales
3. **Market Demand Indicators:** Search volume, view counts, watchers
4. **Category Popularity:** How active the category is
5. **Brand Recognition:** Well-known brands typically move faster
6. **Trending Status:** Current market trends and seasonal factors

## Why Velocity Matters

### For Resellers:
- **Capital Efficiency:** High velocity items let you reinvest profits faster
- **Risk Management:** Fast-moving items reduce risk of price drops
- **Scalability:** Can process more items with same capital
- **Cash Flow:** Faster sales = better cash flow

### Example Scenario:
- **High Velocity Item:** $10 buy → $50 sell in 1 week = $40 profit, repeat 4x/month = $160/month
- **Low Velocity Item:** $10 buy → $50 sell in 3 months = $40 profit, only 1x/quarter = $40/quarter

Same profit per item, but **12x more profit per month** with high velocity!

## Balancing Velocity and Profit

The best reselling strategy often balances:
- **High Velocity + High Profit** = Best case (rare, jump on these!)
- **High Velocity + Low Profit** = Still good for volume
- **Low Velocity + High Profit** = Acceptable if profit margin is very high
- **Low Velocity + Low Profit** = Avoid (not worth the capital tie-up)
