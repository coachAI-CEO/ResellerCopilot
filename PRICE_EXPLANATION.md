# Price Fields Explanation

## Understanding the Different Price Types

When analyzing a product, you'll see several price fields. Here's what each one means:

---

## 🎯 Market Price (Sell Price) ⭐ **MOST IMPORTANT**

**What it is:** The estimated price you can **SELL** this item for

**How it's calculated:**
- Based on **recent COMPLETED/SOLD listings** (not asking prices)
- Average of actual sales on eBay/Amazon
- Represents what buyers have actually paid recently

**Why it matters:**
- This is the price used to calculate your profit
- Represents realistic selling expectations
- Based on actual market data, not wishful thinking

**Example:** If recent sold listings show $80, $85, $78, $82 → Market Price ≈ $81

---

## 💰 Current Listing Price

**What it is:** The lowest price you could **BUY** this item for right now

**How it's calculated:**
- Lowest current active listing across eBay/Amazon
- What someone else is asking for it now
- NOT what it sells for, just what's available

**Why it matters:**
- Shows market competition
- Helps understand if market is flooded
- Less important for profit calculation (you already have the item)

**Example:** You might see a listing for $90, but recent sold listings average $81

## Important Notes

1. **Market Price is Key:** This is what your profit calculation is based on
2. **Sold Listings > Asking Prices:** Always trust completed sales over current listings
3. **Market Price ≠ Current Listing:** Items might list for $100 but only sell for $80
4. **Why the Difference Matters:** 
   - Buy at store: $10
   - Current listings: $90 (what others are asking)
   - Recent sold: $80 (what people actually pay)
   - **Your profit is based on $80, not $90**
